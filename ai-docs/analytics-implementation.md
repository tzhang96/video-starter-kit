# Analytics Implementation Checklist

## Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure and UI
- [x] Install Recharts package
- [x] Add analytics state to store (isOpen, selectedCategory, selectedModel)
- [x] Create basic AnalyticsDialog component
- [x] Add Analytics button to header
- [x] Implement dialog open/close functionality

## Phase 2: Basic Statistics and Charts

## Notes
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- We can test functionality after each phase
- Phases 1-2 give us immediate visual feedback
- Phase 3 ensures we don't recompute unnecessarily
- Phase 4 adds the AI analysis capability
- Phases 5-6 make it production-ready

## Dependencies
- Recharts for visualization
- Existing IndexedDB setup
- Gemini integration for prompt analysis
- Existing UI components (Dialog, Button, etc.)
